# Parameterized-Barrel-Shifter

## Description

Construct a parameterized module in which the input width can be specified by a parameter. To
simplify the design, we assume that width of the input is 2N and the N is used as the parameter.

1. Design the circuit and derive the code.

2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.

3. Design a testing circuit for a 16-bit input and derive the code.

4. Synthesize the circuit, program the FPGA, and verify its operation.
